-- ISSUES
- CUSTOM SCROLLBARS DO NOT WORK IN FIREFOX AND EDGE (probably only work on chrome. that sucks)
- THERE IS NO WARNING FOR LOADING A BUILD WHILE YOUR CURRENT ONE IS UNSAVED !!!!!!!!
- escapist does not grant its skill
	also applies to anything else that grants skills I guess. Except proto
- small issue: tooltips from talents expand the page (meaning they lengthen it and make an ugly scrollbar appear)
- text are edits are lost if you do not unblur (click anything else) before leaving page/popup
- deleting a build doesn't unload it - is this an issue?
- skills dont show if they directly apply stacks (ex. aero touch)
- tooltip for enrage is MASSIVE - prob also happens for a few other skills that didnt have their <font> tags pruned. these aren't supposed to be supported anymore though weirdchamp
- too many keywords in a build prob causes some issue in the builds dropdown
- defiance has a lot of redundant text in the keywords screen
- some builds store a 'null' keyword
- can't override author once it's set for a build
- config author field is wonky, needs 2 keystrokes to start adding input
- some skills are missing icons, because they are on different sheets (easy fix)
- some stats do not have friendly names yet, ex. Battered_StackInfluence_Enemy
- context menu for subnodes has weird clickboxes (I think the issue is that only the text is clickable, not the whole div)
- if the author name field is unset, "by {empty}" is still appended in saved builds menu
- i forgot to change the goddamn tab name and icon like i always do
- loading builds from the gallery and saving them should change their guid to prevent wonkyness
