- text are edits are lost if you do not unblur before leaving page
- deleting a build doesn't unload it - is this an issue?
- cancelling out of deleting a build undoes your changes
- highlighting skill abilities in stat display no longer works
- skills dont show if they directly apply stacks (ex. aero touch)
- tooltip for enrage is MASSIVE
- too many keywords ina build prob causes some issue in the builds dropdown
