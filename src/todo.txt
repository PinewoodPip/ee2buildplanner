-- ISSUES
- escapist does not grant its skill
-- also applies to anything else that grants skills I guess. Except proto
- skills that are once-per-combat show -1 CD
- small issue: tooltips from talents expand the page
- text are edits are lost if you do not unblur before leaving page
- deleting a build doesn't unload it - is this an issue?
- skills dont show if they directly apply stacks (ex. aero touch)
- tooltip for enrage is MASSIVE
- too many keywords ina build prob causes some issue in the builds dropdown
- "save build" button doesn't instantly update its color warning
- defiance has a lot of redundant text in the keywords screen
- some builds store a 'null' keyword
- can't override author once it's set
- config author field is wonky
