------------ KNOWN ISSUES ------------

- CUSTOM SCROLLBARS DO NOT WORK IN FIREFOX AND EDGE (probably only work on chrome. that sucks)
- escapist does not grant its skill
	also applies to anything else that grants skills I guess. Except proto
- tooltips from talents expand the page (meaning they lengthen it and make an ugly scrollbar appear)
- text are edits are lost if you do not unblur (click anything else) before leaving page/popup
- deleting a build doesn't unload it - is this an issue?
- skills dont show if they directly apply stacks (ex. aero touch)
- too many keywords in a build prob causes some issue in the builds dropdown
- defiance has a lot of redundant text in the keywords screen
- can't override author once it's set for a build
- some stats do not have friendly names yet
- context menu for subnodes has weird clickboxes (I think the issue is that only the text is clickable, not the whole div)
- most artifacts do not have periods at the end of their descriptions
- on low width resolutions, the new build button is only clickable from the left
- some places don't have correct rounding, showing a ridiculous amount of decimals
- you can put newlines in the character and author name fields
- changing subnodes sometimes crashes the app
	no idea how to reproduce this consistently. This might be only happening in a dev environment when a file is reloaded with a context menu open
- Attributes from runes count as invested
