------------ KNOWN ISSUES ------------

- CUSTOM SCROLLBARS DO NOT WORK IN FIREFOX AND EDGE (probably only work on chrome. that sucks)
- escapist does not grant its skill
	also applies to anything else that grants skills I guess. Except proto
- small issue: tooltips from talents expand the page (meaning they lengthen it and make an ugly scrollbar appear)
- text are edits are lost if you do not unblur (click anything else) before leaving page/popup
- deleting a build doesn't unload it - is this an issue?
- skills dont show if they directly apply stacks (ex. aero touch)
- tooltip for enrage is MASSIVE - prob also happens for a few other skills that didnt have their <font> tags pruned. these aren't supposed to be supported anymore though weirdchamp
- too many keywords in a build prob causes some issue in the builds dropdown
- defiance has a lot of redundant text in the keywords screen
- some builds store a 'null' keyword
- can't override author once it's set for a build
- config author & character name text fields are wonky, need 2 keystrokes to start adding input
- some stats do not have friendly names yet
- context menu for subnodes has weird clickboxes (I think the issue is that only the text is clickable, not the whole div)
- most artifacts do not have periods at the end of their descriptions
- on low width resolutions, the new build button is only clickable from the left

------------ PLANNED FEATURES ------------
- Drag and drop reordering for skills, artifacts and aspects
- Slide-in animation for sidebars
- Equipment menu where you can manage equipment modifiers and runes
- Armor runes
- Runes in general
- Revamped, clearer stats screen
