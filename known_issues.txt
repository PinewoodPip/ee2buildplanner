------------ KNOWN ISSUES ------------

- CUSTOM SCROLLBARS DO NOT WORK IN FIREFOX AND EDGE (probably only work on chrome. that sucks)
- escapist does not grant its skill
	also applies to anything else that grants skills I guess. Except proto
- tooltips from talents expand the page (meaning they lengthen it and make an ugly scrollbar appear)
- text are edits are lost if you do not unblur (click anything else) before leaving page/popup
- deleting a build doesn't unload it - is this an issue?
- skills dont show if they directly apply stacks (ex. aero touch)
- tooltip for enrage is MASSIVE - prob also happens for a few other skills that didnt have their <font> tags pruned. these aren't supposed to be supported anymore though weirdchamp
- too many keywords in a build prob causes some issue in the builds dropdown
- defiance has a lot of redundant text in the keywords screen
- some builds store a 'null' keyword in the json (possibly from effects like sortilege on staff attack)
- can't override author once it's set for a build
- some stats do not have friendly names yet
- context menu for subnodes has weird clickboxes (I think the issue is that only the text is clickable, not the whole div)
- most artifacts do not have periods at the end of their descriptions
- on low width resolutions, the new build button is only clickable from the left
- in the keywords screen, clicking on a keyword that has talent-granted boons will crash the app if you haven't modified your aspects since loading the app (possibly fixed now)
- some rune boosts are shown twice on tooltip
- some places don't have correct rounding, showing a ridiculous amount of decimals
- you can put newlines in the character and author name fields

- Slide-in animation for sidebars
- Equipment menu where you can manage equipment modifiers and runes
